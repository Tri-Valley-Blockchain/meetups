#Windows Setup
* Install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://beta.visualstudio.com/downloads/). If you choose a custom installation, the bare minimum items that need to be checked are all pertaining to Visual C++ (Current version is VS 2017)
* Install the [Windows SDK for Windows](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk)
* Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) if not already installed, and make sure to [add its install location to your PATH](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2014/02/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-8-1/)
* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you don't have it and add it to your PATH 
* Install OpenSSL from [here](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). Make sure to choose the right package for your architecture, and only install the full package (not the light version). You must install OpenSSL at its recommended location — do not change the install path
* Download and install [node v8.9.x LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
